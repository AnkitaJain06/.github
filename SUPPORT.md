### Asking questions & reporting issues

We have multiple channels where you can ask questions about OpenRewrite:

* [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/rewriteoss/shared_invite/zt-nj42n3ea-b~62rIHzb3Vo0E1APKCXEA)
* [Discord](https://discord.gg/xk3ZKrhWAb)
* [https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/discussions](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/discussions)
* [https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/issues](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/issues)
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/openrewrite)

We monitor all of these channels and try to respond in a timely manner. Please only post your question in a **single channel** so that we don't spend time looking into questions that may have already been answered elsewhere.

Furthermore, when asking a question or reporting an issue, please be as specific as possible and include details that will help us immediately dive in. For instance:

1. Share what you have read and tried already so that we don't end up sending you to places you've already been.
2. Explain how you are running OpenRewrite. Are you using Maven? Gradle? [Moderne.io](https://app.moderne.io)? Something else?
3. Provide the version numbers of the Maven or Gradle plugin, OpenRewrite itself, and any rewrite modules you may be using.
4. Add as much of your OpenRewrite configuration as you're able to share so that we can rule out configuration issues.
5. Let us know what recipe you are running, especially when using a `rewrite.yml` file.
6. Include a before and after. Also, what did you expect the after to be?
7. When errors occur, please include the output of `--stacktrace` for Gradle or `--debug` for Maven.
8. Ensure that you are asking questions or reporting issues on the respective OpenRewrite module if at all possible.

By doing all of these things, you will not only help us get you answers more quickly, but you will help out the community who may search for these details in the future.
